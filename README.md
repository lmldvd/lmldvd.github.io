# :notebook: My Sketchbook

## :question: What are you working on?

This is a little project I started to help me learn GitHub. I am working with Pages for the first time while I am also learning how to "git" because I know this will be beneficial later as I continue to learn to code.

## :pencil: Technologies used here

I'm going to be learning javascript, and hopefully implementing here on other repositories. For now, my skills are on HTML and CSS. I am an illustrator originally, and have always been interested in coding, so there will be a lot of both things combined.

## :airplane: Launch

The address for this project is: https://lmldvd.github.io <- Tap or click here to view My Sketchbook.
From what I read on the tutorial, this page is using the Jekyll platform. Most writing is done using Chrome. Edge, Opera or Firefox are good alternatives to view the project. The site is responsive so it will look fine on mobile.
