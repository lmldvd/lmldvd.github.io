This is a project that I started with the help of a few HTML/CSS tutorials. I used a few resources such as w3 schools, freecodecamp, dreamweaver, illustrator and codepen. The purpose is to create an elegant and responsive version of an existing webpage. I chose APOD NASA because it can certainly benefit from a new look.

Recently, I worked on adding more branding elements including some font options.
