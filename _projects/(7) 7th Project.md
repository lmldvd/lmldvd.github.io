This is a project that I started with the help of a few HTML/CSS tutorials. I used a few resources such as w3 schools, freecodecamp, dreamweaver, illustrator and codepen. The purpose is to create an elegant and responsive version of an existing webpage. I chose APOD NASA because it can certainly benefit from a new look.

Recently, I worked on adding more branding elements including some font options.

The APOD archive contains the largest collection of annotated astronomical images on the internet. This work is something I started to practice my knowledge of web design and it is not sponsored or endorsed by NASA. All the images, logos and photography come from the apod.nasa.gov website. New branding elements and layouts are added by me.
