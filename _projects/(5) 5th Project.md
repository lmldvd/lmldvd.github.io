## Survey Form Web Design

A Survey Form page where you can answer questions, tick checklists and explore dropdown menu choices. It is designed with this in mind: I want to fill out this information without thinking about it too much, and be able to submit it. This a project in the Free Code Camp curriculum for HTML/CSS and Responsive Design.
