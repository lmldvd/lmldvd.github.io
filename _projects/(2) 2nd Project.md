# Technical Documentation Page

The Technical Documentation Page is something like a **Wiki**. In it I can show a responsive layout, linking images, anchors, navigation menus that stick to the sidebar and even code blocks!

## Basics of CSS coding

![css](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9461/css-declaration-small.png)

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

CSS is one of the core languages of the open Web and is standardized across Web browsers according to the W3C specification. Developed in levels, CSS1 is now obsolete, CSS2.1 is a recommendation, and CSS3, now split into smaller modules, is progressing on the standardization track.
