Here you can preview a phone wallpaper I made. I used adobe illustrator and photoshop to create it. To create the mockups, I used affinity photo to place the image into the phone artwork or photo. A background was adjusted to fit into the showcase. You can download a large version, just _right-click on the image_ and select _View image_.

## Showcase
