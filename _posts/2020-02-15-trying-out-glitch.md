## 1. Preview the app

<div class="glitch-embed-wrap" style="height: 486px; width: 100%;">
  <iframe
    allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; encrypted-media"
    src="https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/gratis-lord-h07tgf7btm?previewSize=100&previewFirst=true&sidebarCollapsed=true"
    alt="gratis-lord-h07tgf7btm on Glitch"
    style="height: 100%; width: 100%; border: 0;">
  </iframe>
</div>

Cool!

I made this quick web page on Glitch to learn more about the platform. It shows an EP mockup and Music Poster design I made. Oxóssi on Gourmet Beats is one of my favorite artists and I wanted to show designs that would compliment their music.
