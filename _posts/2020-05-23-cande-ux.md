## What is the CANDE app?

CANDE is my idea of a lifestyle app showcase. With it you could journal your meals, workout schedule, sleep cycles and other health particulars. CANDE the word comes from 'candela'. It is a Spanish word that means Spark. Candela is used in some Spanish-speaking countries for describing an inspiring moment. Candela is also used when someone is experiencing ardent emotions like taking on a great challenge. I know of the Candelaria as the night of burning all that which is bringing you down. You destroy worldly possessions and you move on with your life.
