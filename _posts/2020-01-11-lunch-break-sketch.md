## 1. Information about the drawing

A pencil and pen sketch of a cat sleeping next to a camera.

## 2. A bit of story behind the drawing

I had a longer lunch break today so I decided to walk outside to the mess hall. Sitting for such a long time is not the best way to work. Anyway, this sketch of a cat happily napping is my ideal lunch break mood. Check out some more views.
