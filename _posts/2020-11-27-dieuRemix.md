# Which work was the inspiration?
[Dieu Neo](https://www.behance.net/gallery/87120911/Dieu-Neo-Website) by Rron Berisha.

# What other things inspired the remix?
Serif font pairings, trips to the museum, paintings, editorial layouts. 

What I wanted to accomplish with this exercise is to go back to school. I feel like at times you need to revisit the basics. Many assignments I had back then were similar to this; so you took an existing work and tried to make it yourself and make it as similar to the original as possible. Nowadays in coding I see Remixes and that takes me back to the work I did in school.
