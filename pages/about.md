# About Me

Hi, I am **Lucienne**. :v:<br>
I'm an illustrator based in Atlanta, where I work as a visual information specialist. The illustration approach to the work I create is heavily inspired by cinema, role-playing games, cosmic themes, minimalist and environmentally-conscious spaces.

I graduated in 2009 with a bachelor of science (bs) in Illustration. It is fascinating to me how media arts and coding can come together to deliver an amazing piece.

My favorite thing to work on now is creating meaningful and user-friendly interfaces that are accessible to anyone.
